Total Access Communication Public Company Limited was established as a limited company in August 1989 by Bencharongkul family to provide wireless telecommunications services in 800 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands under a  Build-Transfer-Operate  concession granted by CAT Telecom Public Company Limited (formerly known as Communications Authority of Thailand, CAT).
</p>
<br>
<p>
To promote the development of telecommunication services in Thailand, the private sector was allowed to participate in the telecommunication market under concessions on a Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO) basis with two state enterprises, which has been corporatized as TOT Corporation Public Company Limited (TOT) and known as TOT Public Company Limited and CAT Telecom Public Company Limited (CAT). In 2012, dtac Trinet Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, has obtained the spectrum license for mobile telecommunications in the Frequency Band 2.1 GHz from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) and provides service in 2013.
